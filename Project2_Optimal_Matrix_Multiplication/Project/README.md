======================

This project uses a matrix multiplication kernel to provide a basic understanding of parallel comuting using CUDA.
The matrix multiplicion kernel consist of two N x N matrices. This project consists of 5 files and a description 
of each can be found below. The base level code was provided by for TTU CS5375 course by Mert Side, Ghazanfar ALI, 
and Yong CHEN. The orginal repo can be found [here](https://github.com/mertside/CS5375_GPU_Lecture).
